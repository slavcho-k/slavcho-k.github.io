I"ú<p>GPU prices are sinking, and they've been for months. A recent report shows just how quickly prices are going down, claiming that prices have dropped by 50% as the markket deals with the crypto fallout.</p>

<p>According to the data, the average price of a RTX 3080 on the secondhand market has dropped by nearly 50% since April.</p>

<p>Although multiple factors contributed to the GPU shortage, the demand from cryptocurrency miners seems to be the main driver. In the first half of 2021, for example, a quareter of all GPU sales went to crypto miners. Some estimates suggest that miners spent $15 billion on GPUs just for mining Ethereum.</p>

<p>Both AMD and Nvidia saw a huge boom in their growth, particulary, Nvidia saw 50% growth in revenue in the last two years, despite the fact that the company reportet that less than 1% of it's gaming-related sales came from the company's mining-focused GPUs. Nvidia added a limiter to it's gaming graphics cards to discourage mining, but hackers were able to bypass that completely in May.</p>

<p>In May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) find Nvidia $5.5 million for not disclousing the influence of crypto on its revenue over the past few years.</p>

<p>The rapid drop in prices comes on the heels of around $800 bilion in crypto value deisappearing from the market. Prior to that point, GPU prices were starting to approach MSRP. Now, you can find several of the best GPUs, brand new, for sale under list price. </p>

<p>It's an interesting time for GPUs, not only because they're becoming cheap, but also because Nvidia and AMD are getting up to release new generations. Nvidia is working on it's RTX 40 - series and AMD has it's RX 7000 GPUs, and we expect to see both of the series by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The price could bounce back up, if demand from crypto miners does as well. On the other hamd, we may see a repeat of the crpyto fallout that happened in early 2018. Similar to 2020, crypto boomed in late 2017 and caused a GPU shoratge. Once prices returned to normal, AMD and Nvidia were stuck in a tough spot with pallets of GPUs that there was little demand for.</p>
