<p></p>

<p>The IT industry is very wide and broad. Even entry position salaries start at around $60.000 in the US. High-end jobs can range from $250.000 to $500.000 per year, but those jobs require many years of experience, certain certification, and other skills. If you're someone looking for a job in tech, be prepared to roll up your sleeves, and get to work!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. Cloud Architect</h2>

<p>A cloud architect designs cloud networks. As cloud storage becomes more mainstream, it shouldn't be a suprise that this job position is becoming more and more in-demand. Some statistics suggest that some larger organizations may have up to 200 different cloud platforms, all of which need to be maintained, upgraded and kept in check. The average salary in the US for this position is $134.265 yearly.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for â€˜aiming for the stars.â€™ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
