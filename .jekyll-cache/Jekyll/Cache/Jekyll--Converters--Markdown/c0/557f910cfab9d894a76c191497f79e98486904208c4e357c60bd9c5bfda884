I"<p>GPU prices are sinking, and they've been for months. A recent report shows just how quickly prices are going down, claiming that prices have dropped by 50% as the markket deals with the crypto fallout.</p>

<p>According to the data, the average price of a RTX 3080 on the secondhand market has dropped by nearly 50% since April.</p>

<p>Although multiple factors contributed to the GPU shortage, the demand from cryptocurrency miners seems to be the main driver. In the first half of 2021, for example, a quareter of all GPU sales went to crypto miners. Some estimates suggest that miners spent $15 billion on GPUs just for mining Ethereum.</p>

<p>Both AMD and Nvidia saw a huge boom in their growth, particulary, Nvidia saw 50% growth in revenue in the last two years, despite the fact that the company reportet that less than 1% of it's gaming-related sales came from the company's mining-focused GPUs. Nvidia added a limiter to it's gaming graphics cards to discourage mining, but hackers were able to bypass that completely in May.</p>
