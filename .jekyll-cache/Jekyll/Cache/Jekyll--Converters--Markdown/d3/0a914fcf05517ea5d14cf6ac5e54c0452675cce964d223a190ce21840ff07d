I"+	<p>Bitcoin plunged to about $17.000 and Ether fell to about $897 at around 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, as the sell-off in the crypto market accelerates. Later that day the prices bounced back to around $19.000 for BTC and $1.000 for ETH.</p>

<p>The carnage in the crypto market is partly caused by pressur from macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation. It doesn't help that crypto firms are laying off large swaths of employees, and some of the most popular names in the industry are facking solvency meltdowns. </p>

<p>For perspective, BTC peaked at $68.789 in November, while ETH peaked at $4.891 that same month BTC last traded this low in December 2020.</p>

<p>If crypto's bubble are anything to go by, then BTC could be about to fall much further. </p>

<p>According to one strategist, who warns the world's top cryptocurrency is likely to tank as low as $12.000 - an almost 40% drop from current levels. </p>

<blockquote>“We would still be selling these kinds of cryptocurrencies into this environment. It really is a liquidity play. What we've found is it's neither a currency, nor a commodity and crertainly not a store of value. ”</blockquote>

<p>Ian Harnett, co-founder of Absolute Strategy Research</p>

<p>Explaining his bearish call, Harnett said past crypto rallies show BTC tends to fall roughly 80% from all-time highs. In 2018, for instance, the crypto plummeted close to $3.000 after hitting a peak of nearly $20.000 in late 2017. </p>

<p>That's taken its toll on digital assets. The combined value of all cryptocurrencies plunged more than $350 billion in the past two weeks. Bitcoin was trading at around $20.000 last Tuesday, and it was down 5% in the last 24 hours. The No.1 crypto has lost more than half of it's value year-to-year date.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the crypto market was already on shaky ground before the Fed's rate hike last week, with traders roiled by the %60 billion collapse of popular stablecoin TerraUSD and it's sister Luna</p>
