<p>Hey there! My name is Slavcho. I'm a first year student at the FCSE Skopje. Starting from an early age, I was always interested in technology. Ever since I've gotten my first personal computer at the age of 4, I haven't stopped doing something IT related. Even tho everything started with playing Mame32, eventually as I grew older, I expanded my skillset, everything from graphic design, to video editing and programming.</p>

<p>Highly motivated and enthusiastic, I'm eager to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I love learning, I also like to challenge myself, and do fun things that have a positive impact. I don't like just coming up with ideas, instead I feel the urge to act on them.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I like to dvelop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. Currently my biggest interests, and what my energy is shifted towrads is learning the fundamentals of programming, and after that becoming and expert for AI, machine learning and Blockchain technologies.</p>
